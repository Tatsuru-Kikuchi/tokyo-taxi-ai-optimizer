    **AI-powered taxi optimization system with weather-driven intelligence**
    
    ### üéØ Core Features:
    - **Driver Positioning**: AI tells drivers where to go based on weather conditions
    - **Passenger Decision Support**: Smart advice on taxi vs alternatives during weather events
    - **Weather Intelligence**: 0.847 correlation between rain and taxi demand (University of Tokyo research)
    - **Real-time Integration**: JMA weather + ODPT traffic + Research algorithms
    
    ### üî¨ Research Backing:
    - **Institution**: University of Tokyo Faculty of Economics
    - **Researcher**: Tatsuru Kikuchi  
    - **Proven Results**: 30.2% productivity improvement with weather-AI integration
    - **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.05
    
    ### üåü Key Endpoints:
    - `/api/v1/weather/driver/hotspots` - Driver positioning recommendations
