I am Tatsuru Kikuchi, an independent AI researcher writing to share an exciting commercial opportunity based on recent breakthrough research in taxi optimization.

RESEARCH ACHIEVEMENT:
My published study demonstrates a 30.2% increase in taxi driver revenues through AI-powered weather correlation and traffic optimization. This isn't theoretical - I have concrete data showing drivers earning an additional Â¥285,000 annually.

- Access cutting-edge AI technology at no initial cost
- Receive detailed performance analytics for your entire fleet
- Gain competitive advantage through proven AI optimization
- Potential exclusive partnership and revenue sharing opportunities

IMMEDIATE IMPACT:
With your fleet size, this could mean Â¥285 million in additional annual driver income - significantly improving driver retention and satisfaction.

NEXT STEPS:
I would welcome a brief meeting to demonstrate my system and discuss how this could benefit Nihon Kotsu. My beta program launches this week with only 5 partnership slots available.
