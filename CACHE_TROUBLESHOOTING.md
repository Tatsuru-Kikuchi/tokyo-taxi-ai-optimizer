# GitHub Pages Cache Busting Guide

## The Issue
GitHub Pages has extremely aggressive caching (up to 1 month on some content) that can prevent updated sites from showing immediately.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Browser-Level Cache Clearing
- **Hard Refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Developer Tools**: F12 → Network tab → Check "Disable cache" → Refresh
- **Chrome**: Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
- **Complete Cache Clear**: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → "Cached images and files"
- **Incognito/Private Mode**: Try opening the site in a new incognito window

### 2. Alternative URLs to Try
- Add query parameters: `?v=2025-07-31` or `?cache=bust`
- Try the enhanced.html directly (if created)
- Use the raw GitHub URL

### 3. GitHub Pages Settings Reset
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Change source to "None" → Save
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Change back to "Deploy from a branch" → main → Save

### 4. DNS/CDN Bypass
- Try different devices/networks
- Use mobile data instead of WiFi
- Try different browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced UI code deployed
- ✅ Cache-busting headers added
- ✅ Multiple deployment attempts made
- ⏳ Waiting for cache propagation

The enhanced version with massive text and ultra-wide layout is ready - just waiting for the cache to clear!
